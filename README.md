# Reinforcement Learning for Stock Market Trading

This project is based on the research paper ["A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10059). The goal is to use reinforcement learning to optimize stock market trading.

## Project Overview

The environment is represented by the prices of all orders throughout the marketâ€™s history up to the moment where the state is taken. Due to the vastness of the full order history, we sample the order-history information by dividing the time into periods and taking the maximum, minimum, and closing prices in each period.

The action is represented as: $\left(w_1, \ldots, w_n\right)$ 

The state is represented as: $\left(X_t, w_{t-1}\right)$ where prices are $X_t$

The reward function is defined as:

$$
R\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{1}, \boldsymbol{a}_{1}, \cdots, \boldsymbol{s}_{t_{\mathrm{f}}}, \boldsymbol{a}_{t_{\mathrm{f}}}, \boldsymbol{s}_{t_{\mathrm{f}}+1}\right) & :=\frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{f}}} \ln \frac{p_{\mathrm{f}}}{p_{0}}=\frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{f}}} \sum_{t=1}^{t_{\mathrm{f}}+1} r_{t} .
$$
